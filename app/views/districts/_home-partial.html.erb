<p>West of the Village you can find the Quartier Latin, a small area next to the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) campus. This neighbourhood has an energetic atmosphere and houses a concentration of bars, restaurants, theatres and other hangouts. It may be more active in the wee hours of the night than by day. In contrast, the Quartier Latin is also home to the impressive Grande Bibliothèque du Quebec.</p>
